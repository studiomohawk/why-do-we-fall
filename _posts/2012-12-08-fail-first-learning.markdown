As Remy Sharp said at [.net](http://www.netmagazine.com/interviews/remy-sharp-learning-breaking-stuff):

> The only way you learn is by doing it and failing, breaking it and seeing how it goes back together

HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
These are my primary tools to solve problems.

Learning a language brings me back the first day I arrived at airport in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Let's say I was not a "smart guys" who thought I should study aboard.  
I only knew a handful of English words back then. So I've kept failing. 

Like every single day for almost 5 years.

But I was curious enough to stay there.  
And I've graduated.

I'm not gonna say my English is perfect and that's not the point.

The point is: **I've learned how to learn.**
 
Some might say, after all those 5 years in university, after spending *that* much money to study abroad, only thing I've learned is **that**?

For me, **that** matters a lot.  

I become more comfortable around failures when I'm learning something new.  

I still hate to fail.  
That's why I try hard.  

And that's how I get to speak English.  
And that's how I get to good at what I do.  

Every time I read some of my heroes/heroins in this industries say "Fail fist to learn" kind of thing, I become more confident on *"This is the only way to learn."* feeling of mine.  

In the movie, Batman Begins, Alfred Pennyworth said:

> Why do we fall, sir?  
> So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.

Watch me fall and pick something up.
And hope you do the same.
